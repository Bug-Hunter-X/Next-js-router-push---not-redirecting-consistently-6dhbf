# Next.js router.push() Inconsistencies

This repository demonstrates a problem where `router.push()` in Next.js doesn't always trigger a redirect. The issue is particularly noticeable when using certain event handlers or within specific component lifecycles.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a potential fix.

## Problem
The original code uses `router.push` within a simple button click handler. However, in certain conditions (e.g., rapid clicks or interactions within complex forms), the redirect may fail.

## Solution
The solution explores the use of `router.replace` which can provide more reliable behavior. Additionally, error handling and potentially using event listeners instead of the default onClick event could be considered for more robust redirect management.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Observe the unexpected behavior (or lack of redirect) when clicking the button repeatedly or under specific circumstances.
5. Compare the results with the solution in `bugSolution.js`.
